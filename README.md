## about the name
Crane stands for Divide and Conquer Modular ReAsoNEr (CRANE). We employ ELK and a modified version of HermiT as delegate reasoners, with modifications made to the Enhanced KP algorithm within HermiT and HermiT's codebase.

We use Crane's name as a  "shout-out" to the works and concepts that inspire or relate to our project. In Chinese history, [Bu Lin (林逋)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Bu) is known as a distinguished **hermit** and poet, known for his symbolic companionship with a Chinese plum and a **crane** (梅妻鹤子), highlighting the crane's significance in various cultures. Similar to the **owl**, the crane is a bird. In English, the word "Crane" also refers to a type of machine. **Chainsaw**, another modular reasoner whose name also refers to a type of machine. Crane is also inspired by the modular reasoner **MORe**. It is hard to think about a name covering all of them. So, thanks, MORe people!
